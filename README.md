# Linux Command: Commenting
This project focuses on best practices for commenting in Linux, primarily in shell scripting and system configuration files. 

Commenting is crucial for code readability, maintenance, and collaboration. This project provides various examples of effective commenting styles to help developers and system administrators write clear and well-documented scripts.

### Features
- Explanation of commenting in different Linux environments
- Best practices for writing comments in Bash scripts and configuration files
- Real-world examples demonstrating proper commenting techniques
- Guidelines for balancing clarity and efficiency in comments

### Examples
#### Bash Script Commenting
Bash scripts use `#` for comments. Example:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# This script prints "Hello, World!"

echo "Hello, World!"
```

#### Multi-line Comments in Bash
Although Bash does not natively support multi-line comments, you can use `<<COMMENT ... COMMENT` as a workaround.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

<<COMMENT
This is a multi-line comment.
It is useful for providing detailed explanations.
COMMENT

echo "Multi-line comments demonstration."
```

#### Configuration File Commenting
Many Linux configuration files use `#` or `;` for comments. Example in a `.conf` file:

```sh
# This is a commented line in a configuration file
max_connections = 100
```

#### Python Commenting in Linux Scripts
Python scripts also use `#` for comments:

```sh
# This script prints "Hello, Linux!"

print("Hello, Linux!")
```

### Usage
Review the `examples/` directory to study different commenting techniques. You can run the sample Bash scripts as follows:

```sh
bash examples/sample_script.sh
```
